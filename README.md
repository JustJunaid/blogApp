# Building Database Application.

This project is built in _MERN_ stack and still in progress.

## About The Project/ How the Project Works.
In this project, there is a form in which Buildings data is entered and submitted to the Database. Along with that when you submit the form, a table is shown below to visualize the structure of the building, like on each floor, how many flats are there, reserved, unreserved, etc. <br/>
With Each entry in the DB, a building block is added to the stack in the card shown in the left side of the UI for looking the data from the DB. <br/>
When you click any block from the sidebar, a drawer/modal from left side overlays on the screen showing the Data of the building which is fetched from the DB. Last but not the least, there is DeleteDB button provided to cleanup the data.<br/> 
UI is also clean and overall it's a cool project and there's lot more to add to it.

## Choice of Technology/Framework.
As i mentioned it is built in MERN stack, why i choose that because simply it's mind-blowing and trending too. By the way, MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React and Node. MongoDB as the database, Express as a web dev framework, React on the client side and Node on the backend or server side. <br/>
Apart from that i have also used PrimeReact as a UI framework which is pretty cool and simple, and i make sure that i don't use Bootstrap because everytime i use that only.<br/>
There are lots of Edge cases handled with proper error messages but there is lot more to do.

## Installation
Simply git clone it and perform the following command inside the root directory as well as in the client directory.

```bash
npm install
npm i
```
